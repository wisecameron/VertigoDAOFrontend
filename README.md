VertigoDAO Frontend

This is the code for vertigodao.com, a massive react/three.js/react-three-fiber/GLSL website with countless unique systems including a particle system, infinite city generator, over 10 unique scenes, custom shaders, and much more.  The website also features extensive web3 integration.  

This project is meant as a resource for developers learning related skills, and is particularly useful as a way to decode how scenes are implemented and the process of mounting and unmounting them based on the scroll position.  I would recommend first checking out the website, finding the effect you are interested in, then locating the corresponding file(s) in the code base for reference.
